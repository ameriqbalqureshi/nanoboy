# NanoBoy â€“ Arduino Nano Game Development Library ðŸŽ®

NanoBoy is a lightweight game development framework for the **Arduino Nano** (ATmega328P) with an **SSD1306 OLED display** and push buttons.  
It is inspired by the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/), but designed as a **DIY educational kit** using DIP components that are easy to solder.

With NanoBoy you can:
- Draw graphics (sprites, tiles, text).
- Handle input from buttons.
- Play simple sounds with a buzzer.
- Build tilemap-based games (Pac-Man, Snake, Pong, Breakout).
- Detect collisions between sprites or between sprites and the map.
